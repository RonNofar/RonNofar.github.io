# Recent work

[![Maya Attribute Comparer v2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1AePrDkZU8d0DCxUX-ospVngLpSxp2e37)](http://github.com/RonNofar/RToolPackage)

### Above is a newer iteration of the attribute comparison tool

> I am reworking this tools to be more intuitive and reliable based on suggestions from modelers, riggers, and animators.
> The UI has more built in functionality, allowing the user to compare specific attributes.

### Above is an attribute comparison tool for Maya made in Python (April)

> A tool I am developing for an animator that allows the user to store and compare attribute values for any Maya node.
> New features are being added as requested.
> Can be found in the RTool Package repository under attributeComparerGUI.py for now but will get its own repository for distribution and organization.

[![Recent Maya API work](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1y0Jwi5O0aKMcEuwnlbSxSkAwnvRNeoNF)](http://github.com/RonNofar/RToolPackage)

### Above is one of the recent examples of my work in Maya API (Jan - Mar)

> I have been recently learning the Maya API in order to create tools for speeding up production pipelines. 
> I am also currently working with Maya MASH API for procedural animations.
> I have taken these tools and combined them with other Python tools I have written over the years. 
> This package is named "RTool" and can be acquired through pip.

### Above is a machine learning agent learning to use an arm and sword (12/20/17)

> First try using rigidbody joints for Unity's ML-Agents API.  
> The fighter is somewhat blind and is only aware of the distance from the sword to the goal.

[![Soccer using Unity's Machine Learning](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xaBPT9u0imw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaBPT9u0imw)

### Above is machine learning agents playing soccer in Unity (12/13/17)

> After about a week and a half of experimenting with Unity's ML-Agents API, I started changing the way I train the same agents.
> You can see The differences in play styles with evolved from different reward systems.

[![First machine learning try in Unity](https://img.youtube.com/vi/75ecS3_3bAQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75ecS3_3bAQ)

### Above is a machine learning test in Unity (12/3/17)

> This is my first try at using Unity's new machine learning API. None of it is a part of Unity yet and so the necessary components are very scattared and there is little to none documentation on this.
> If you need help setting this up, shoot me an email (in my resume).
> Click on the image above to see the video demo.

[![A Unity prototype of a mechanic](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kB-inekeAoQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB-inekeAoQ)

### Above is a recent mechanic prototype (11/23/17)

> This mechanic was inspired by Portal, Antichamber, and Budget Cuts (VR). I am currently working on integrating this into the LockTag VR game I'm working on in order to have smooth transition between teleportation.
> I believe replicating the teleport mechanic from Budget Cuts with a few modifications will lead to less confusing and more seemless gameplay.

[![A Unity prototype of level design](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fmQHXP3qq_c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmQHXP3qq_c)

### Above is a recent level prototype (11/15/17)

> This is a project originally not intended to be a game. This is built off of a 3D world-wraping mechanic I developed a while back. I started this project again as a level design challenge.
> The video above is an older version of the same level but the download link on the left leads to the latest _stable_ version and tests out some lighting meant to guide the player.
