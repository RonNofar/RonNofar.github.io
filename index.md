### Above is a recent mechanic prototype (11/23/17)

> This mechanic was inspired by Portal, Antichamber, and Budget Cuts (VR). I am currently working on integrating this into the LockTag VR game I'm working on in order to have smooth transition between teleportation.
> I believe replicating the teleport mechanic from Budget Cuts with a few modifications will lead to less confusing and more seemless gameplay.

### Above is a recent level prototype (11/15/17)

> This is a project originally not intended to be a game. This is built off of a 3D world-wraping mechanic I developed a while back. I started this project again as a level design challenge.
> The video above is an older version of the same level but the download link on the left leads to the latest _stable_ version and tests out some lighting meant to guide the player.
