# Recent work

[Recent Maya API work](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1y0Jwi5O0aKMcEuwnlbSxSkAwnvRNeoNF)

### Above is one of the recent examples of my work in Maya API (Jan - Mar)

> I have been recently learning the Maya API in order to create tools for speeding up production pipelines. 
> I am also currently working with Maya MASH API for procedural animations.

### Above is a machine learning agent learning to use an arm and sword (12/20/17)

> First try using rigidbody joints for Unity's ML-Agents API.  
> The fighter is somewhat blind and is only aware of the distance from the sword to the goal.

### Above is machine learning agents playing soccer in Unity (12/13/17)

> After about a week and a half of experimenting with Unity's ML-Agents API, I started changing the way I train the same agents.
> You can see The differences in play styles with evolved from different reward systems.

### Above is a machine learning test in Unity (12/3/17)

> This is my first try at using Unity's new machine learning API. None of it is a part of Unity yet and so the necessary components are very scattared and there is little to none documentation on this.
> If you need help setting this up, shoot me an email (in my resume).

### Above is a recent mechanic prototype (11/23/17)

> This mechanic was inspired by Portal, Antichamber, and Budget Cuts (VR). I am currently working on integrating this into the LockTag VR game I'm working on in order to have smooth transition between teleportation.
> I believe replicating the teleport mechanic from Budget Cuts with a few modifications will lead to less confusing and more seemless gameplay.

### Above is a recent level prototype (11/15/17)

> This is a project originally not intended to be a game. This is built off of a 3D world-wraping mechanic I developed a while back. I started this project again as a level design challenge.
> The video above is an older version of the same level but the download link on the left leads to the latest _stable_ version and tests out some lighting meant to guide the player.
